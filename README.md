# Chatgpt-Maths-Accuracy-Enhancer

This project presents a multi functional mathematical assistant that seamlessly integrates symbolic computation with machine learning-powered 
image recognition. This assistant is not only a computational tool but also an educational aid that enhances mathematical understanding and productivity in both academic 
and real-world settings.


 LIMITATIONS IN EXISTING SYSTEM 
1. Lack of Symbolic Computation: 
Most AI language models, including Chat- GPT, rely on pattern recognition and prob- abilistic techniques to 
generate text, which works well for general language tasks. However, mathematics requires precise 
symbolic computation and step-by-step logi- cal reasoning, which these models are not inherently designed 
to perform. This leads to incorrect answers, especially in complex mathematical problems. 
2. Inconsistent Handling of Mathematical Queries: 
As observed in multi- ple experiments and supported by the research, ChatGPT strug- gles with consis- 
tency when handling similar mathematical queries. It may provide correct answers to simpler problems but 
fails to address more complex or nuanced queries. This inconsistency reduces the reliability of AI as a tool 
for mathematical learning or assistance. 
3. Ambiguity in Responses: 
When faced with mathematical problems, Chat- GPT tends to provide answers that are vague or incomplete. 
For instance, it may skip key steps in the solution process or offer general explanations without detailed 
breakdowns. This lack of clarity can be confusing for users, especially those seeking precise assistance 
with academic or professional mathematical tasks. 
4. Limited Contextual Understanding in Word Problems: 
Research has shown that AI models like ChatGPT often misinterpret mathematical word prob- lems due to 
their inability to fully understand the context and logic behind them. This limitation is particularly 
problematic for more advanced mathematical in- queries, where contextual understanding is key to 
providing an accurate solution. 
5. Dependence on Training Data: 
The performance of AI systems like Chat- GPT is heavily dependent on the quality of the training data they 
receive. If the training data lacks sufficient mathematical content or examples, the model will struggle to 
provide correct solutions, especially for niche or specialized mathematical queries.
